			<h1>Hi, my love</h1>
			<p>
				In the Dill lab, our story begins,
				I asked for your social, hoping for wins.
				But coyly you smiled, a mystery afar,
				I wondered then, what kind of girl you are?
				<br>
				Yet as I knew you, I found much more,
				Rediscovering myself, I began to soar.
				With you, I shed my walls, open and free,
				Flirting with words, a dance of glee.
				<br>
				From friends to lovers, our journey took flight,
				Creating memories, painting love bright.
				Our first hug, a moment divine,
				In your arms, a place that's mine.
				<br>
				Oh, the adventures we've had, so grand,
				Traveling together, hand in hand.
				The comfort you bring, so pure, so true,
				In your presence, my world anew.
				<br>
				For any mistakes, my love, I'm sorry,
				In your eyes, I see our shared story.
				Childish and free, you make me see,
				The beauty of love, boundlessly.
				<br>
				So here's to us, in this love we share,
				Forever and always, beyond compare.
				With you, my heart forever stays,
				In your love, I find my days.
